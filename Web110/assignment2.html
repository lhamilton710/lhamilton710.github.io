    <p>Browsers-</p>
<p>a.) For Session 2, Part 1, I chose “configure browser extensions and add ons” as one of the two activities I would complete. I know I will use Google Chrome more than I typically do during this class since last week I was only able to get my github assignment to work on Chrome and not Firefox. Due to this, I decided to install adblock on Chrome, since I like to avoid unnecessary ads when possible. To complete this, I originally went to the top 3 dots in the R corner of the screen and clicked on extensions. When I searched for adblock this way, I couldn’t find it, so instead I went to google and googled “adblock for chrome”. I was able to find adblock this way and easily install it. When I checked extensions again, I saw adblock among my listed extensions. This is a very useful skill to have for the future for whenever I need to install a necessary extension on my computer. For example, AI has boomed in the past 6 months or so. I imagine I may need to install chapgpt onto my computer at some point. There are chrome extensions for chatgpt that are free to use that may be required in future jobs to work faster and more efficiently.</p>

<p>b.) For Session 2, Part 1, I chose “compare browser html5 compatibility” as the second of the two activities I would complete. I clicked on the links provided in Wikiversity to compare the two browsers I have on my computer: Firefox and Chrome. According to HTML5 Accessibility, Chrome is 98.5% accessible, whereas FireFox is 94% accessible. It’s important to be aware of HTML5 accessibility to make sure people accessing websites have the same experience and can easily find what they need and navigate the page. This is important to keep in mind for the future if I were to go into UX because I would want to best experience for each user and ensuring your website is compatible with most browsers will accomplish that.</p>

     <p> Search Engines-</p>
<p>a.) For Session 2, Part 2, I chose “use search engines” as the first of the two activities I would complete. I first tried searching for “search engine market share” and then “’search engine’ ‘market share’” to see if I would get different results. The first two results I received were the same, but the third website that popped up on google was different. When I tried the same search in wikiversity, I received a result of the wiki page I was just on as my first result whether I used quotes or not. The rest of the results I received were different for quotes or no quotes. I noticed that google gave me stats websites, whereas wikiversity gave me other economic articles and SEO articles. It was hard to tell whether quotes or no quotes gave me better results since the webpages that were recommended for each were very similar to each other. I imagine that adding quotes should give more targeted results. I can see this being beneficial for future school assignments, particularly research projects since it’s important to use reliable sites with relevant information for research. I also imagine it would cut down on research time to use quotes to get more relevant results.</p>

<p>b.) For Session 2 Part 2, I chose “learn about search engine optimization” as the second of the two activities I would complete. The definition of search engine optimization according to Wikipedia is, “Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines”. An example of good SEO would be the Wikiversity page being used for this homework. I typed “internet fundamentals search engines” into google and the Wikiveristy page was the first result to pop up. Moz.com goes into detail explaining how to make websites more likely to appear for viewers. They have a hierarchy of tips based on Maslows Hierarchy of Needs to create the best SEO. I know SEO will be relevant to me if I pursue web design. It doesn’t matter how good a website looks or is designed if users can’t find it easily. If I were to go into the SEO field, or just web design in general, I know I would need to be aware of making my website more likely than other websites to appear on google so I can draw more people to my site.</p>
