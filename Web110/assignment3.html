    <p>Part 1: Activity 4—View email message headers
      <br></br>
The activity I chose to complete on Wikiversity for this activity was Email Spoofing. Email spoofing is when a hacker or illegitimate source alters fields in the email message header to make an email seem legitimate, when in reality is likely contains malware or is trying to trick the receiver in some way. According to Wikiversity, “The main difference between spam and a spoofed message is that spammers don't edit email headers to pretend that the email was sent from someone else. Both phishing and spoofing emails aim to trick someone to believe the message was sent from a legitimate sender”. Phishers will often try to get the receivers private information for financial gain. This is important for my current and future environment because I currently get fake emails occasionally and need to avoid opening any links to prevent downloading a virus on my computer. I know many companies also do phishing “tests” where their IT department will send out fake emails to train employees to report them and not click on them. It’s always important to be suspicious of scams and to check the actual email address of a sender if an email seems remotely suspicious.

Part 2: Activity 3—The Honeycomb Model of social media.
      <br></br>
The activity I chose to complete was reading about the Honeycomb Model and how that applies to various social media websites. The Honeycomb Model describes 7 different categories for successful social media marketing: sharing, presence, relationships, identity, conversations, reputations, and groups. Depending on the purpose of the social media a person is using, they may focus on some areas more than others. The two websites I will compare will be Youtube and Reddit, since those are the social media I use regularly. Youtube does a good job of hitting all areas of the honeycomb. Identity and sharing: Youtubers are typically personal and share information about themselves and why they make certain types of videos. Prescence: Youtube videos are often shared across multiple social media platforms, creating a large presence. Relationships and groups: regular watchers of specific Youtubers often have conversations in the comments section and form communities. Reputation: Typically different Youtubers have differing levels of respect based on what type of content they make, so you can easily tell “reputable” from “non-reputable” Youtubers. Reddit does well on some of these points too, such as fostering conversations, groups, relationships and sharing due to the many subreddits. However, because Reddit is anonymous, individual users do not have much of a presence and identity, which is different from most other types of social media where people often use their real name and photo for their profile. It was interesting to learn what the building blocks are of a good social media website and I agree that all of them are important to having a presence online. This would be valuable future information for anyone going into social media marketing or social media management.
