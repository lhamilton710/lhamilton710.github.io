    <p>The activity I chose to complete is Tracing Internet Traffic. As described by howtogeek.com, the purpose of using the command Traceroute is to determine Internet connection problems. By using this tool, you can trace the route from your computer to a website and the various stops it takes at other routers along the way. It also displays how long it takes to get to each steppingstone router before you finally reach your desired website. This is important for determining connectivity issues. If you do not get a display of time in milliseconds and just see an asterisk, then you know there may be a connectivity issue at that level. I could see this being important in my future for determining if my internet issues are due to me, my wi-fi provider, or if the website Iâ€™m trying to get on is just glitchy</p>
