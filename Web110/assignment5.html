    <p>Communication</p>
<p>Activity 3:</p>
<p>The activity I completed was Screen Sharing/Remote Desktop. There are several reasons why a person may need to access a computer remotely. The most common reason is for IT support to fix a problem on a laptop or desktop remotely. Another common reason is to transfer files between computers. The screen sharing program I decided to try was Chrome Remote Desktop. I looked up a Youtube video with step by step instructions on how to do it. First you need to download the Chrome Remote Desktop extension on the computer you’d like to remotely access. Then you would create a name and pin number for that computer. Next, you would go to the website https://remotedesktop.google.com/access from  another computer, or download the app on your phone. From the second device, you can input the pin number and access the first device remotely. I accessed my laptop from my phone and it was actually pretty cool. I personally don’t plan to go into tech support, but I can certainly see how this would be useful to know for people who work an IT help desk.

    <p>HTML</p>
    <p>I actually am taking a separate non-Harper class and have recently learned the HTML concepts that we discussed today in class and have even used W3Schools.com frequently. One thing I like about W3Schools is it gives you the chance to practice the code yourself in their code simulator. It helps to try inputting different examples or even type the code yourself to gain familiarity with how the concept works. I also tried using the W3C: Validator to validate my Github code to make sure everything was formatted correctly. I received a green response, which means that my code was good. Validation is important because issues with a website’s code can lead to less people being able to reach the site and decreased readability of the site as well. I see it like running a spell check before you turn in a paper; you want to check your code to make sure it’s accurate. I could see myself using this in the future as a way to check my projects for accuracy.</p>
