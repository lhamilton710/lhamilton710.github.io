    <h1>Final Project-What I learned</h1>
    <p>There were several things I learned about web accessibility while completing this project. One big thing I did not consider was colorblind people. I knew that generally you would want a website with high contrast so it's more readable, but I didn't think about certain color combinations being difficult for colorblind people to read. I also didn't think about navigating a website with just a keyboard. In fact, I didn't know before researching web accessibility that it was even possible to access a website without a mouse. Web accessibility is very important to keep in mind for web design and web development because you obviously want to be inclusive as possible. Not only is it just a good thing to do, but there are also laws regarding accessibility, such as Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that in 1998 specifically was added on to address electronic accessibility.
      One overarching theme I learned throughout this class is just how many moving parts and pieces comprise the internet we use today. I very much just take the internet for granted and don't ever think about how or why it works. I enjoyed learning about the history of the internet and still think it's pretty amazing that such a concept was created. My favorite thing I learned this semester was how to use remote access, since it felt so cool to control one computer from another computer. Whether or not I continue further into the web design field, I do think that there are many things I learned this semester that will make me a better all-around technology user.</p>
