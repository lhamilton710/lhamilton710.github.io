    <p>Networking</p>
    <p>Activity 1:</p>
    <p>I chose to complete Activity 1, which involved following the tutorials for Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, and Internet Domain Systems. I learned there are two reference models: OSI and TCP/IP. OSI is an older model and stands for Open System Interface. There are 7 layers in this model: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical. Each layer has a different function in connectivity. The TCP/IP model stands for Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. This model has 4 layers: Application, Transport, Internet, Host to Network. </p>
    <p>There are multiple types of Protocols. The Transmission Control Protocol “TCP is a connection-oriented protocol and offers end-to-end packet delivery”. TCP is a reliable and connection-oriented protocol. On the other hand, Internet Protocol (IP) is connectionless and unreliable. It has to be paired with a reliable protocol to make itself reliable. User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is also an unreliable protocol and typically transmits small amounts of data at once. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) both copy and transfer files, but TFPT “transfers the files without authentication. Unlike FTP, TFTP does not separate control and data information”. This makes TFPT less secure than FTP. Lastly, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol that communicates between the web browser and the server. </p>
    <p>Internet Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced as more and more people started using the internet. The DNS “helps to resolve the host name to an address”. The DNS does this through use of IP Addresses, Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), and various Domain names. All of these are ways to organize and send information on the internet to ensure they reach the right source. </p>
    <p>All of this information was relatively new to me. I’ve certainly heard of many of these acronyms before, but I didn’t know what they stood for or how they were connected to each other. I think knowing the structure of the internet can be very important when going into web design and troubleshooting issues that arise. Knowing exactly how to figure out why a website is not working will make your business run smoother and make clients happier.</p>
    <p>Activity 7:</p>
    <p>The second activity I chose to do for networking was research how to set up a home network yourself. I watched a video on Youtube which described how to set one up. The first thing I would need would be a modem. A modem can either be provided by the ISP a person is using, or it can be bought separately. Next, a wifi router is needed to plug into the modem. The router is responsible for security for information coming in, and it also sends out IP addresses for proper connectivity. A switch can also be plugged into the router with more ports for plugging in other things. Recently, my dad had to buy a new modem since his was old and it was too expensive to lease one. When I activated the new modem for my dad, I didn’t actually have to call anyone from Comcast; I could just download the Comcast app and activate it from his account. The information in this video is useful because any time I move in the future, I will have to re-set up the wifi and will need to know how to do it.</p>

    <p>Security</p>
    <p>Activity 1</p>
    <p>The activity I chose to complete for the security section was tutorialspoint.com’s overview of Internet Security. This section goes over the basics of internet security and what internet users need to watch out for to protect themselves. Some new information I learned in this tutorial are what hashing is. A “hashing algorithm provides a way to verify that the message received is the same as the message sent.” If the hash value the receiver computes doesn’t match the hash value of the decrypted message, then you know the message is altered. I also learned that digital signatures can help improve security, which I previously was not aware of, “digital signatures allow us to verify the author, date and time of signatures, authenticate the message contents”. Knowing basic cyber security is important to anyone who has a computer. There are so many scams and ways your information can be stolen, so I definitely want to know how to protect myself and my data.</p>
