    <p>SQL-</p>
    <p>SQL stands for structured query language. It is a programming language used to manage data stored in relational databases. A relational database are organized in rows and columns and stores data in tables. When you search these tables, you can find data in relation to each other. SQL is used on websites for "back end data storage and data processing solutions". Some examples of websites that use SQL are Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, other social media, banking apps, and more. I suppose it's good to know what SQL is, but I personally don't think it will be too relevant to me in the future. I don't think I would be good at back end programming and don't know how much daily use I would get out of SQL.</p>
