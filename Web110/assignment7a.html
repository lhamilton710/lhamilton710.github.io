        <p>In this session I learned about the difference between raster images and vector images. Raster images are made of pixels, whereas vector images are made of lines. Examples of raster image software would be Adobe Photoshop, and vector image software would be Adobe Illustrator. For this assignment, I decided to create a raster image with GIMP. I've never used GIMP before, so I watched a few Youtube tutorials to familiarize myself a bit. I learned it's similar to Photoshop, but doesn't seem to have quite as many features. For my raster image, I used GIMP to cut the photo of the mermaid and the dog out of one photo and insert it in the background photo with the ocean. I can see GIMP being useful if I don't have access to Photoshop in the future and need a free image editing software.

    <p>I also learned about audio, video and YouTube videos in this multimedia session. In order to add audio or videos to an html page, they must first be converted to an mp3 file format. Then, you link the mp3 to the html page using the audio, video, or iframe tags. This is important for making webpages interactive and interesting, and also for demonstration purposes. For this assignment, I converted a YouTube video into an mp3 with an online mp3 converter, then uploaded that to github. I then also linked the same YouTube video using the iframe tag and by copying and pasting the "embed" url from YouTube.</p>
