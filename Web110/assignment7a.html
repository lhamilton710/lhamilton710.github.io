        In this session I learnd about the difference between raster images and vector images. Raster images are made of pixels, whereas vector images are made of lines. Examples of raster image software would be Adobe Photoshop, and vector image software would be Adobe Illustrator. For this assignment, I decided to create a raster image with GIMP. I've never used GIMP before, so I watched a few Youtube tutorials to familiarize myself a bit. I learned it's similar to Photoshop, but doesn't seem to have quite as many features. For my raster image, I used GIMP to cut the photo of the mermaid and the dog out of one photo and insert it in the background photo with the ocean. I can see GIMP being useful if I don't have access to Photoshop in the future and need a free image editing software.
