    <p>Project Management-</p>
    <p>The topic I chose for my final project is web accessibility. In my project, I plan to discuss what accessibility is and what it means in an internet context. I will also describe some common disabilities that may require web accessibility. Finally, if I can find examples online, I will show examples of websites that have poor accessibility and explain why it’s not good.</p>
    <p>One thing I learned in the project management section is that a project can be successfully completed, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it was successfully managed. I want to keep that in mind when working on my final project to prevent excess stress along the way and to ensure a better outcome. I think monitoring and controlling will be important for me personally to make sure my project is successfully managed. This means staying on top of my schedule to get ahead of problems and not be scrambling right before it’s due to fix any issues.</p>
