    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p style="color:darkviolet;"> I learned from TutorialsPoint.com that there are 4 main methods of implementing CSS onto webpages: Inline style sheets, Embedded style sheets, External Style Sheets, and Imported style sheets. Inline style sheets are included with the HTML element. Inline style sheets only affect the element they are included with. Embedded style sheets seem to be the same thing as Internal style sheets, which we discussed in the CSS lecture. Embedded style sheets are placed in the <head> tags and affect the styling of whatever elements are specified in them (for example: {p: color:green} would make all the text in paragraph tags green). External style sheets are “are the separate .css files that contain the CSS rules. These files can be linked to any HTML documents using link tag with rel attribute”. Imported style sheets import style rules from other style sheets. You must type @import before typing the css file path. CSS is important for anyone going into web design or development. CSS and HTML are like peanut butter and jelly; they need each other to create the best final result. I am interested in exploring web careers so knowing CSS will be important for me.</p>
